# Fritz.StaticWeb

A simple static blog generator built to support the [KlipTok blog](https://kliptok.com/blog). 

It's built as a command-line tool that can run against a folder of templates and blog posts in markdown format. 

The eventual goal is that this repository generates a GitHub action that will be used to generate the KlipTok blog in that repository
